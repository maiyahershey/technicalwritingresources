## Markdown

**What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

Thus, Markdown is two things:
1. a plain text formatting syntax
2. a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.
